Project Title: 
JohnsonJonathanBadBank

**Description/Motivation: **

The badbank is an ongoing MERN stack application that is intended to demonstrate the interactivity and functionality of the frontend with the backend and database.  The first revision was made with no inputs, user information or data validation. Subsequent revisions have added middleware, data validation and input forms.  The most recent v3 has improved refactoring to keep the code as clean as possible and has the addition of a dockerized backend linked to a mongoDB database.
